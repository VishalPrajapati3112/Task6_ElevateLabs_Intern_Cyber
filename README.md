| Some Password Lists                     | Strength Result       | Comments                                              |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| admin123, shivam                       | Weak                  | Common, short, no special characters                  |
| qwerty123, 7896387612                  | Weak                  | Predictable, dictionary word, mobile number           |
| 12345678, 111111                       | Weak                  | Very common, found in breaches                        |
| @Shivam                                | Moderate              | Better, has uppercase + symbol                        |
| $S@chin1                               | Moderate to Strong    | Good mix, still somewhat guessable                    |
| ShiVam@2005                            | Strong                | Obfuscated characters, symbols, length                |

| $h!vam@7258                            | Strong                | Mix of upper & lower case, contains symbols           |
| $$hiVaM_7258                           | Strong                | Long, mix, random                                     |
| $S@ch!n-5318                           | Very Strong           | Random words + numbers                                |
| B5@kKs!#=d7                            | Very Strong           | Complex and lengthy, random                           |

ðŸ“Ž *Note: Passwords shown here are examples used for testing only.*


### ðŸ§  Key Learnings

- Use 8 or more characters
- Combine uppercase, lowercase, symbols, and numbers
- Avoid common words or personal info
- Use a password manager
- Always enable multi-factor authentication (MFA)

### ðŸ›¡ Common Password Attacks

- **Brute Force Attack** â€“ Tries every possible combination  
- **Dictionary Attack** â€“ Uses lists of common words/passwords  
- **Credential Stuffing** â€“ Reuses leaked username-password pairs  
- **Password Spraying** â€“ Tries a few common passwords on many users  
- **Phishing** â€“ Fake login pages to steal credentials  
- **Keylogging** â€“ Malware records what you type  
- **Shoulder Surfing** â€“ Observes typing directly in public

---

### ðŸ“Š Outcome / Result

After testing 15 passwords of varying complexity:

- Weak passwords were instantly marked insecure  
- Adding uppercase, symbols, and length improved strength  
- Passphrases and random characters created strong results  
- Complex passwords showed resistance to brute force (centuries to crack)

âœ… This task enhanced my understanding of password security, helped me analyze vulnerabilities, and taught me how attackers exploit weak credentials. It also highlighted the importance of using password managers and MFA for added protection.
